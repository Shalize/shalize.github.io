   		<h1>Graduation Day</h1>

   	   <h4>31st of May 20XX</h4>
   	   <p>I have always thought that I would never survive till that moment; that all those troubles with attitude, food and money would last forever; that I came to Jyväskylä alone and I would go alone. Luckily, I was wrong.</p>
   	   <p>I learnt how to make Mexican chefdeuvres out of the X/tra and Rainbow products, became helthier with JyTLS training for professional figure skaters, travelled to Stockholm in the storm. My Finnish and English language skills reached the sky, while self-confidence grew into Fjords. I found good friends from the most distant countries around the globe, crashed on a sect-addicted musician and get his mother's respect, met immigrants from Russia and sang karaoke with them in the Turkish bar. I found another truth.</p> 
   	   <p>Bad things do happen all the time. But if we give up now, we will never be able to give a better opportunity for those versions of us who will come later. Those, who will be better than we are. Those, who will never be mistaken in what they do. Those, who know  what they are fighting for. We don't have to perfect now, because we are imperfectly perfect already.</p>
